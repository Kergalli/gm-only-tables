# Changelog

All notable changes to the GM Only Tables module will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-17

### Fixed
- Fixed installation error where Foundry incorrectly detected module updates due to mismatched download URLs
- Corrected module.json manifest and download URLs to point to specific release versions instead of main branch

### Technical Notes
- No functional changes to module behavior
- This is purely a packaging/installation fix for better compatibility with Foundry's module management system
